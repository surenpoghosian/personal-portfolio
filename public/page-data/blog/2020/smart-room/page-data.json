My goal was to create solutions that make it easy to control various devices in my home, turning my living space into a more interactive and convenient environment.\n\n## Connecting Devices to Amazon Alexa\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T0VOl6i1NTQ?si=X5OZCYixbn2mBXaT\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nTo start, I integrated the ESP32 modules with Amazon Alexa. This allowed me to control different devices, like the curtains in my room and the table light, using simple voice commands. For example, I can say, “Alexa, good morning” and the ESP32 takes care of the rest, moving the curtains smoothly.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nQ9dyZtRP0I?si=GS2xhllPHrBSUEcB\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nSetting up the connection was an exciting challenge. I had to write code for the ESP32 that communicates with Alexa. I used a library called [Espalexa](https://github.com/Aircoookie/Espalexa) to pair the ESP module with alexa. Once everything was connected, I could control my devices easily and quickly with just my voice.\n\n<span style={{ color: 'white' }}>.</span>\n![Prototype](./assets/curtain.jpeg)\n\nThe mechanism I designed uses two wheels placed at each end of the curtain holder. The left wheel is powered by a motor connected to an ESP32, which is also linked to the home’s Wi-Fi network.\n\n## Remote-Controlled RGB Lights\n\n![Prototype](./assets/rgb.png)\n\nIn addition to controlling curtains and lights, I created remote-controlled RGB lights using another ESP32 module. These lights can change colors and brightness, adding a fun and colorful touch to my living space. To control them, I collaborated with a friend who designed a custom app specifically for this purpose.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJ7A9OjeQcs?si=XXAw7Mw3MAhqxLAl\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nWith the app, I can adjust the color and brightness of the lights right from my phone. This feature makes it easy to set the mood for different occasions, whether I’m hosting a party or just relaxing at home. The app communicates with the ESP32, allowing me to control the lights remotely without any hassle.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAmX7Tm-HGA?si=QVdF2JVio5ZBa3sf\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Making My Space Interactive\n\nBy combining these technologies, I’ve transformed my home into a vibrant and interactive space. Being able to control devices with my voice or a smartphone app adds a level of convenience that makes everyday tasks easier. I love how I can set the mood in my room with a few taps on my phone or a simple voice command.\n\n\nLinks:\n - [Curtain source code](https://github.com/surenpoghosian/surenpoghosian/tree/main/Curtain)\n - [ESP Wifi setup source code](https://github.com/surenpoghosian/surenpoghosian/blob/main/Alexa-Controlled-Appliances--master/Controlling_W_O_Internet/Controlling_W_O_Internet.ino)\n - [Table source code](https://github.com/surenpoghosian/surenpoghosian/blob/main/Table_Success_/Table_Success_.ino)\n ","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2020/smart-room/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/Users/surenpoghosyan/personal-website/src/posts/2020/smart-room/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Smart Rooms and Colorful Lights: Designing an Innovative Home Environment","summary":"Discover how I utilized Amazon Alexa and ESP32 modules to create smart home solutions that seamlessly connect to Alexa.
