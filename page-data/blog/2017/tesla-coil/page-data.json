I’d seen videos of these coils producing lightning-like sparks and lighting up bulbs without any wires, and I wanted to experience that for myself. With no real experience at the time, I jumped in, eager to create something cool, but it didn’t quite go as planned.\n\n## The Struggles of a First Project\n\nMy first attempt at building the coil was far from perfect. I spent hours researching, gathering parts, and winding wire around a plastic tube. I tried to follow diagrams I found online, but after wiring everything up, the coil just wouldn’t work. I was frustrated, but also determined to figure out what went wrong. It was during this time that I joined a robotics class, which turned out to be a huge turning point for me.\n\n## Meeting Sargis Keveyan\n\nIn that class, I met Sargis Keveyan, someone who had already built a Tesla coil—a much bigger and more successful one than mine. He showed me how his worked, and that’s when everything started to click. Sargis took the time to explain the details of how the Tesla coil functions: the importance of the transformer, the resonant frequency, and how the spark gap played a critical role in generating high-voltage electricity.\n\nHis guidance was exactly what I needed. Even though my first Tesla coil didn’t work, meeting Sargis gave me a better understanding of what I was trying to build. I didn’t succeed in making a working Tesla coil back then, but the process taught me a lot about electronics, perseverance, and how important it is to ask for help when you’re stuck.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VG8fSupZ-tI?si=2eky2hlvZbzDM11D\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## A Learning Experience\n\nLooking back, that experience taught me more than just technical skills. I realized that failure is just part of the learning process. Without that initial setback, I wouldn’t have had the opportunity to meet people like Sargis or dive deeper into the mechanics of how things work. It also inspired me to keep going and continue experimenting with different projects over the years.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nEven though my Tesla coil didn’t spark, the experience definitely did. It lit a fire inside me to keep learning and exploring the world of technology. I’m grateful for the help I received along the way, and for the lessons that came with trying (and failing) to build something on my own.\n\nIf you’re reading this and thinking of starting your own project, don’t be discouraged if it doesn’t work right away. Keep at it, ask for help, and take each failure as a step closer to success.\n\n\n### Helpful links:\n- [demo v1](https://youtu.be/rVthWA0XgmU?t=139)\n- [demo v2](https://youtu.be/i0Y1JH6p67I?t=124)\n- [demo v3](https://youtu.be/i0Y1JH6p67I?t=240)\n","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2017/tesla-coil/"},"internal":{"contentFilePath":"/home/runner/work/personal-portfolio/personal-portfolio/src/posts/2017/tesla-coil/index.mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"From Childhood Curiosity to Engineering: My Journey with the Tesla Coil","summary":"Discover how my childhood curiosity led me to build a Tesla coil as my first project, sparking a lifelong passion for engineering and shaping my journey in technology.","date":"01 June, 2017","cover":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ec83dc979ab485dc1ce281d7eefc57a1/515e0/cover.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ec83dc979ab485dc1ce281d7eefc57a1/65114/cover.jpg 750w,\n/static/ec83dc979ab485dc1ce281d7eefc57a1/30473/cover.jpg 1080w,\n/static/ec83dc979ab485dc1ce281d7eefc57a1/515e0/cover.jpg 1152w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ec83dc979ab485dc1ce281d7eefc57a1/9e21e/cover.webp 750w,\n/static/ec83dc979ab485dc1ce281d7eefc57a1/ec502/cover.webp 1080w,\n/static/ec83dc979ab485dc1ce281d7eefc57a1/214f0/cover.webp 1152w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6666666666666666}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2017/tesla-coil/","frontmatter":{"title":"From Childhood Curiosity to Engineering: My Journey with the Tesla Coil","summary":"Discover how my childhood curiosity led me to build a Tesla coil as my first project, sparking a lifelong passion for engineering and shaping my journey in technology.","cover":"assets/cover.png","date":"2017-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
