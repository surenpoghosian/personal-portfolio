title: "Creating a Network-Attached Watering System: Leveraging ESP32 and LoRa for Soil Data Collection"

summary: "In this project, I built a network-attached watering system using ESP32 and a LoRa module to collect soil information with advanced sensors. The devices communicate among themselves, sending data to a master device that relays it to a server. This information is stored in a database and visualized through a Telegram bot for each user, facilitating effective monitoring and analysis of soil conditions."
