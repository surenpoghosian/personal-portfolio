title: "Crafting Power Supplies: Turning Any Input into Adjustable Voltage for My Projects"

summary: "I built two power supplies: the first converts 220V into a controllable 1.5V to 36V output, and the second takes any input up to 36V and regulates it. Both are designed to provide precise voltage control for different projects."
